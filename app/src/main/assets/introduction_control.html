		Although treatment of leprosy is one of the ways to control its spread, more importantly, tackling the most basic issues such as population control, improvement in living conditions of the underprivileged, basic education about the diseases, and dispelling the myths associated with the disease are more important issues.<br />
<br />
In order to achieve this, it is important to know  the magnitude of the problem and the available resources.  Estimates of  the prevalence of leprosy are essential for planning and implementing  an anti&ndash;leprosy program, and also to evaluate its results.   Epidemiological surveys can be conducted to find cases of leprosy.   Certain target populations could be surveyed e.g. slums, overcrowded  dwellings etc.  The aim of case detection is to identify and register  all cases of leprosy as soon as possible after they&rsquo;ve become evident.   Surveys are usually carried out by primary health care workers (village  health guides, multi&ndash;purpose workers) in case detection with the active  participation of the community.<br />
<br />
The case identification is based on the finding of skin patches which  have no sensation.  Leprosy, like all other communicable diseases is an  important disease that merits attention if we have to achieve the  object of &lsquo;Health For All&rsquo;.<br />
<br />
<strong class="subtitle">The three main goals of leprosy control are</strong>
<a href="#" class="read_more">Read More</a><br/>
 <div class="more_text"'>
<ul>
  <li> To interrupt the transmission of infection, thereby reducing the incidence of the disease, so that it no longer constitutes a public health problem.</li>
  <li> To treat patients in order to achieve their cure and wherever possible, rehabilitate them. </li>
  <li> To prevent the development of associated deformities. </li>
</ul>
It  is unfortunate that there has not been much progress in terms of research as compared to other diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.<br />

<br />
<strong class="subtitle">Rehabilitation</strong><br />
Rehabilitation is therefore an integral part of leprosy control.  It must begin as soon as the disease is diagnosed.  The cheapest and surest rehabilitation is  to prevent physical deformities and social and vocational disruption by  early diagnosis and adequate treatment.<br />
<br />
<strong class="subtitle">The following preventive measures are important in the control of leprosy:</strong><br/></br>
<strong class="subtitle2">Health Education</strong><br/>
Health  Education should be directed towards the patient and his family, and  the general public. The patient and the family should be educated about  the need for regular treatment, repeated examination of contacts, self  care regarding the prevention of disabilities, and protection of  children.
<br />
<br />
Generating an awareness among people that leprosy is curable, not all  leprosy patients are infectious, regular and adequate treatment is  essential to obtain cure and prevent disabilities, and that the patient  needs sympathy and social support.<br />
<br />
It should be impressed upon them that leprosy is not hereditary, casual contact with a patient does not cause leprosy.  This can help remove some of the social stigmas associated with the disease.  Health education aims at ensuring community participation in order to achieve these objectives.<br />
<br />
There is a growing realization that technological advances alone cannot  solve the leprosy problem, unless we succeed in involving the public in  the control program. They should be made aware that leprosy is not a  hereditary disease, it is a bacterial disease like tuberculosis and  that it is curable.<br/>
<br />
<strong class="subtitle">Socio&ndash;economic considerations in the control of leprosy</strong><br/>
Preventing contact with infectious cases is an accepted method of controlling the spread of any communicable disease.  It is difficult to envisage effective leprosy control without a significant improvement in the socio&ndash;economic conditions of the affected communities.  The economic and social problems of the patient and his family should be identified and met.<br />
<br />
Leprosy control is a long term activity.  Therefore, planning and  program management are essential ingredients.  An important aspect of  leprosy control is to assess the impact of the control operations on  the endemicity of the disease, and to compare results between different  times and places.  Indicators are required for such an evaluation.  It  is important that these indicators can be easily used. 	</div>
