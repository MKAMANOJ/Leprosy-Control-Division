	The word &ldquo;Leper&rdquo; originates from a Greek word  meaning scaly.  It is one of the oldest diseases known to mankind.  In Nepal, leprosy has been known since ancient times as kushtha rog. The disease has always been stigmatized in Nepal. <strong>Leprosy</strong> affects mainly the skin and peripheral nerves, although as it advances, organs such as the eyes, testes, bones and internal organs could also be affected.<br />
<br />
<strong class="subtitle">More characteristically, it has the following features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Light skin patches with loss of sensation.</li>
<li>Thickening of nerves.</li>
</ul>
As the disease progresses, there is a break down of the skin with the formation of ulcers, a likelihood of the hands and feet to be affected by trauma or burns, especially since they experience no sensation in the affected region. This results in deformities of the hands and face. Also, the nerve supply to muscles can be affected resulting in foot drop, claw toes etc. Thus, the disease does not kill but causes permanent and progressive physical disability including severe mutilation of the face and extremities, and widespread damage to the nerves, bones, eyes and vital organs. If a piece of skin or nerve is taken and examined, the organisms can be seen. The leprosy bacilli resist de&ndash;colorization when stained with acid fast stains (stains also used for staining the tuberculosis organisms). They usually occur in clumps and can be seen both inside and outside the cells. It is, however, difficult to grow these organisms outside the human body. This has made the development of vaccines difficult.<br />
<br />
<strong class="subtitle">Social stigma and leprosy</strong><br />
Leprosy is often referred to as a &ldquo;Social Disease&rdquo;.  The social stigma attached to leprosy is due to the deformities it results in.<br />
<br />
<strong class="subtitle">Leprosy in Nepal</strong><br />
<p>Nepal achieved the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem at the national level in December 2009 and declared elimination in 2010. Department of Health Services acknowledged this achievement as one of the major success stories of the health sector in the past decades. <br />

 <div class="more_text"'>
 Although significant progress has been made in reducing the disease burden at the national level, sustaining the achievement &amp; further reducing the disease burden through delivering quality leprosy services still remain as major challenges.</p>
<p>After meeting the elimination target at the national level, the national strategy was revised to “Sustain Quality Leprosy Services and Further Reduce the Disease Burden due to Leprosy in Nepal: 2011-2015”. Nepal is in the process of implementing National Strategy of Leprosy: 2016-2020 based on WHO&#8217;s Global Leprosy Strategy 2016-2020 &#8220;Accelerating towards the Leprosy-Free World&#8221; which aims to</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen government ownership, coordination and partnership</li>
<li>Stop leprosy and its complications</li>
<li>Stop discrimination and promote inclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>The main principles of leprosy control are based on early detection of new cases, stop discrimination and timely and complete treatment with multi-drug therapy (MDT) through integrated health services. The programme has a major target for achieving district level elimination and to reduce grade II disability below 1 per million populations by 2020. Despite targeting for further reduction in disease burden, the programme saw an increase in prevalence rate from 0.77 per 10,000 pop in FY 2066/67 to 0.89 per 10,000 population in 2072/73 (2015/16) and more than 3000 new cases are detected annually. Total cases treated by MDT are more than 1,80,000.</p>
<p>We are focused to work on passive case detection activities but some activities are also focused on active case findings, case management and rehabilitation including medical &amp; community-based rehabilitation. Without expediting the activities for stopping transmission and early case diagnosis, it is next to impossible to achieve elimination at the district level.</p>
<p>Ministry of Health designated Leprosy Control Division as the Disability Focal Unit related to health on 30 Chaitra 2071. Now, we are following Policy, Strategy and 10 Years Action Plan on Disability in close coordination with National Federation of Disabled-Nepal and partners through LCD and Disability Focal Unit.<strong> There are six strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting Health Services</li>
<li>Treatment</li>
<li>Prevention</li>
<li>Rehabilitation</li>
<li>Human Resource/Capacity Building and Organizational strengthening</li>
<li>Information, Technology and Data</li>
</ul>
<p>In the process of federalism, we have to work closely in partnership with different stakeholders without compromising the quality services at the central, provincial, local and up to the ward level. Let&#8217;s join hand to work together to reduce the burden of disability or disability, zero stigma and discriminations, and quality of life.</p>
